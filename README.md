## My process

1. I start off by creating a very simple html layout with no css styling

2. I tried out a new technique where I had the design image as an image background so I could more accurately recreate it

3. With this I create the styling using Sass

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass

### Continued development

This version is still unfinished and I plan on updating it with javascript
